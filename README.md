# Convex Optimization for PEAs
Code for Convex Optimization for Spring Design of Parallel Elastic Actuators and Series Elastic Actuators.

"matlab" has the MATLAB code for Convex Optimization for Spring Design of Parallel Elastic Actuators and Series Elastic Actuators. Details in "README.md" within this directory.

"python" has the Python code for Convex Optimization for Spring Design of Parallel Elastic Actuators and Series Elastic Actuators. Details in "README.md" within this directory.

**Note**: Due to some numerical issues with the Python version of the convex optimization toolbox, the authors highly recommend users to use MATLAB version at this moment.
